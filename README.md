### Photo Automation

The `photo_automation.py` script detects an SD card, prompts for shoot details, copies media to the SSD, opens Lightroom, archives the session and optionally uploads it to WeTransfer.

#### Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python photo_automation.py --api-key YOUR_WETRANSFER_TOKEN
```
