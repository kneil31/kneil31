### Photo Automation

The `photo_automation.py` script demonstrates how you can recursively copy photos
from a source folder to an SSD, launch Lightroom for import, create a zip archive
and optionally upload it to WeTransfer.

#### Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python photo_automation.py --api-key YOUR_WETRANSFER_TOKEN
```

The script will detect mounted SD cards, ask for the event information, copy the
media to the SSD and optionally upload the resulting ZIP archive to WeTransfer.
